# House Price Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features.

## Dataset

This project uses the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle:
- Dataset URL: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
- Required files:
  - `train.csv` - Training data
  - `test.csv` - Test data
  - `data_description.txt` - Description of features
  - `sample_submission.csv` - Example submission format

To get started:
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle
2. Place the CSV files in the `data/` directory
3. The data files are gitignored to keep the repository clean
