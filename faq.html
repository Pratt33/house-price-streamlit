        <div class="question">
            1. Why does Lasso perform well in RMSE but very poorly in R²? What is the relationship between these two metrics?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            RMSE measures average prediction error, while R² measures how well the model explains variance. Lasso can have a low RMSE if it predicts close to the mean, but if it underfits and doesn't capture variance, R² can be very low or negative. So, a model can have a reasonable RMSE but poor R² if it underfits.

            2. What is the main advantage of using Ridge over Lasso for this dataset?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Ridge keeps all features by shrinking coefficients, which helps when many features are relevant. Lasso can remove too many features, leading to underfitting and poor R².

            3. What is the main takeaway from your results?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Ridge Regression gave the best balance of accuracy and generalization, with an average error of ~$14,500. The pipeline and features are effective for this problem.

            4. What steps did you take to ensure your model generalizes well?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            I used feature engineering, regularization, and compared multiple models. I validated on unseen data and plan to add cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

        <div class="question">
            5. Why did you include both linear and ensemble models?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Linear models are interpretable and fast. Ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost capture complex patterns. Comparing both ensures the best model is chosen based on real performance.

            6. How can someone run or deploy your app?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Install dependencies with <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>, then run <code>streamlit run app/app.py</code>. The README has full instructions.

            7. What are your next steps or future improvements?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            I plan to add hyperparameter tuning, model explainability with SHAP, cross-validation, and location-based price maps.

        <div class="question">
            8. What is the main advantage of using log transformation on the target variable?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Log transformation helps stabilize variance and makes the target distribution more normal, which improves model performance and reduces the impact of outliers.

    <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">
            9. Why is model explainability important in this project?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Model explainability (e.g., with SHAP) helps understand which features drive predictions, making the model more transparent and trustworthy for users and stakeholders.

        <div class="question">
            10. How do you handle missing values in your pipeline?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            I use median imputation for numeric features and most frequent or 'Missing' for categorical features, ensuring the pipeline can handle real-world data with gaps.
